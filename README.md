# I-Robocom Team, Malaysia
Meet Team I-Robocom from Malaysia! Our three-member team is dedicated to managing the essential parts of our autonomous vehicle build. Here’s a quick look at our team members and an overview of the key electromechanical components powering our vehicle:
1.	Nelson Soo Hui Leng
2.	Chang Pei Ru
3.	Grace Tan Hong Hui

# 1.0 Mobility Management
## 1.1 Robot Design
The autonomous vehicle robot is mainly built from the Lego 45544 Mindstorms EV3 Education Set. The build of the robot is made up of a chassis, 2 motors and 3 types of sensors.

## 1.2 Motor
We incorporate a combination of 1 Large Motor and 1 Medium Motor to control the robot's operations.

**1. Management of movement**

The autonomous vehicles use 1 Large Motor to drive the robot forward and backward, complemented by a Medium Motor responsible for overseeing the precision of the robot's steering system.

**2.	Motors details and implement**
i.	The Large Motor, a powerful component from the LEGO MINDSTORM EV3 set, boasts enhanced power and torque. We strategically employ this motor to drive the wheel, utilizing a gear system that elevates the initial speed of 175rpm to 1.67 times faster.

ii.	Medium Motor: The Medium Motor, characterized by its lightweight build, increased speed, and heightened precision, is integrated into the robot's steering mechanism. This configuration enables the robot to execute swift and accurate turns, facilitating effective obstacle avoidance.

**3.	Connection motor to the chassis**

i.	A Large Motor is strategically positioned at the robot's base to lower its centre of gravity, enhancing stability during movement and minimizing body roll during turns.

ii.	At the front of the robot, a Medium Motor is intricately attached to govern the straightforward steering mechanism, contributing to precise directional changes.
